At MTOW

Flaps     10 (20)
N2        98-99.5% (full throttle, no more 5 min)
Elevator trim - 1.5 degrees up
Switch landing lights ON.

At 270 km/h up nose (pitch about 10-12 degrees, angle off attack  6-8 degrees, pull yoke
about 1/2 it move range) and plane will take off at speed about 290 km/h.
Maximum ground speed for nose gear 310 km/h and 330 km/h for main gear.

After hight 5m and positive climb retract gear.
After 50m(night),200m(day) switch landing lights OFF.
After hight 120m and speed not less 330-340 km/h retract flaps to 0 degrees.

390-400 km/h - reduce throttle to nominal value 91.5-93.0 % N2.

Accelerate to 500 km/h (460 km/h if need noise reduction procedure)

Climb to altitude 3000 at 500-480 km/h,from 3000m to 6000m at 480-460 km/h,then reduce speed by 5 km/h per 1000m.

Time to reach 9100M  - 21 min.
Time to reach 10600M - 26 min.


CRUISING

At cruising altitude accelerate to desired speed at 91.5-93.0 % N2.
Acceleration time to 0.82M with 93% N2 at 10 600M after reach 10 600M about 10 minutes.

Note: At 93% N2 plane will increase it maximum speed limit.

DESCENDING

Reduce trottle to 81-83% N2 and begin descend 10-12 m/sec at 0.8-0.82M while reach 600 km/h,
than maintain this speed.
Above 8100m maintain 83% N2 or more. Pitch -1 -2 degree.
Below 8100m to 5000M one engine 81% N2 and another  75-68% N2(if practicable).
Below 5000m reduse trottle to 61.7-72.0% N2 or idle.
Below 3000m speed less than 460 km/h and vertical speed less than 15 m/sec.

Emergency descending

Trottle - Idle (61.7-63% N2), pitch 10-15 degree negative, gear down.
Speed 600 km/h, 0.82M. Vertical speed 30-50m/sec.
While ending this mode plane drop 400-500m of altitude.
After emergency descend do not retract gear.


APPROACHING

Typical speed 380-400 km/h at clean plane, and 78-85% N2 and 85-88%N2 with gear down.
Gear down and extend flaps to 20 degree at 360-340 km/h, 86-88 N2.
At 300-320 km/h flaps 30 degree.
Before intercept glideslope flaps 30, gear down, speed 280-300 km/h.
When intercept glideslope decrease throttle to 81-83% N2.
In glideslope use 80-86% N2 (75-82% N2 in case small weight).

Optimal angle off attack  4.5-6 degrees.


LANDING

At 60 m AGL disengage autopilot.
At 20 m AGL begin decreasing vertical speed and at 10 m AGL vertical speed must be about -3m/s
At 7 m AGL smoothly up nose to create 1-2 degree pitch and begin flare.
While flare increase pitch to 3-4 degrees if nessesary to maintain vertical speed less than -1m/s.
Smoothly set throttle to idle and touchdown.
Apply spoilers. After nose gear touchdown activate reversers.
At 250 km/h apply breaks.
Usually reversers off at 110 km/h, but if nesessary it may be used to full stop.
Typical touchdown speed = GS Speed - 20 km/h.

Notes
1. Using more than 2.5 degree pitch when flare will result plane up and quickly drop speed with
hard landing with gear crash possible.
2. Using more than recommended glideslope speed will result as above.
3. Speed less than recommended in glideslope need you use more pitch when flare and result will
same or if use right flare pitch - to big vertical touchdown speed with result as above.
